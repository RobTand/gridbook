# Changelog

## 0.4.0 — 2026-07-31

- Keep dense and grouped-MoE fused native-FP4 prefill behind explicit opt-in
  gates while its different activation contract awaits a served quality A/B.
  The conservative default also avoids the grouped kernel's severe padding
  amplification immediately above its 16-token dispatch boundary.
- Fail closed during model construction on unsupported serving contracts:
  Gridbook now advertises the BF16 dtype its native bindings actually accept,
  rejects FP8-CB below `sm_89`, rejects tensor parallelism above one, validates
  `PRISMAQUANT_CB_PREFILL`, and freezes that selector for the process lifetime.
- Deduplicate exact shared codebook references in fused dense layers, while
  routing layouts with distinct or offset codebooks away from kernels that
  cannot represent them.
- Release unloaded model layers from the compiled-dispatch registry with weak
  ownership and monotonic IDs, and serialize concurrent cold CUDA extension
  loads without adding locks to completed hot-path lookups.
- Reduce avoidable MoE-prefill selection/allocation overhead without changing
  quantization, routing, or kernel arithmetic.
- Require a dotted child boundary when resolving MoE targets, so sibling
  modules such as `experts2` cannot be mistaken for the live expert stack.
  This fix was extracted from Jason Wong's contribution series
  ([@jsconsultancy](https://github.com/jsconsultancy)).
- Add a fail-closed streaming native-parity harness that binds whole-artifact
  bytes, installed software and runtime identity, server evidence, workload,
  phase-specific latency, activation/backend/fallback contracts, and paired
  quality evidence. A successful single-arm report is measurement evidence,
  not by itself a parity or release claim.
- Revalidate `FULL_DECODE_ONLY` CUDA graphs with the opaque default dispatch:
  changed inputs replay exactly against eager at capture sizes 1 and 4, and a
  close-rate 0.6B canary narrows Gridbook decode to 5.9% of native. This remains
  approximate evidence: the CB artifact is 0.154% larger and compares W8A8
  against native W4A4 rather than isolating weight encoding alone.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-07-31

This release incorporates reviewed contributions from Jason Wong
([@jsconsultancy](https://github.com/jsconsultancy)), originally supplied as
the JW2026 patch set, together with integration fixes and expanded coverage.

- Align ignore matching with compressed-tensors and verify external codebook
  provenance before loading.
- Reject malformed codebooks and incompatible native extensions instead of
  silently degrading or risking incorrect numerics.
- Add single-launch CUDA FP4 activation QDQ, measured at 15.7–26.3× operator
  speedups on GB10.
- Add an opt-in shared-memory grouped-MoE decode kernel. Jason's Laguna release
  measured 24.993 versus 23.585 tok/s on GB10, a 5.97% end-to-end improvement.
- Add explicit, byte-budgeted FP4 stock prefill and stronger extension-cache
  diagnostics.
- Document the audited GB10 delegated-NVFP4 backend behavior.

The v2 decode kernel remains an explicit opt-in; inherited production dispatch
is unchanged. GB10 compute capability 12.1 is validated, while 12.0 remains
unexecuted.

Major contributions: Jason Wong (`@jsconsultancy`) — PRs #3, #4, and #6–#11.
Review, integration, and release validation: Robert Tand.
